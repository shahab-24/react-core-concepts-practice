## Project Setup with Vite

We used **Vite** to set up the project, a fast build tool for modern web development. Vite offers instant server start, optimized build outputs, and a fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement).

1. **Create the Project**:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react
